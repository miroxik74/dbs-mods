Hello :>

### ⚠️Warning

Be aware that the changes described require updating some files and you have to create (copy) your folder of BotFiles to another location (just to prevent confusing of what is where), and that you should make changes to the new commands files manually because the app cannot do this.

So you can create commands and nodes in the BSD as you have done so far, but then you should make those changes to the previously described (copied) BotFiles.
