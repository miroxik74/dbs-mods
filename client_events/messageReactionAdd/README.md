1. Make sure you have [`AAA_BetterMods.js`](https://github.com/miroxik74/dbs-mods/blob/main/mods/AAA_BetterMods.js)

2. Download those two files and add them to the `mods` folder:  
- [`reaction_executor.js`](https://github.com/miroxik74/dbs-mods/blob/main/client_events/messageReactionAdd/reaction_executor.js) - the actual code that is executed when someone added reaction
- [`reaction_loader.js`](https://github.com/miroxik74/dbs-mods/blob/main/client_events/messageReactionAdd/reaction_loader.js) - loader to fetch desired channel, message and reactions from it

3. For unicode emoji, you can use:
+ [getemoji.com](https://getemoji.com)
+ [piliapp.com](https://pl.piliapp.com/emoji/list)

That's all you need to know, thanks for reading and good luck :)
