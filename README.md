Hey!  
This repo has been created because i wanted to catch most of the mods but I do not guarantee that all work properly even if I changed some things to at least make them visible in the app which means you don't have to delete one to see another.  
I also want to inform you that in this repository you won't be able to find some mods from main repo because they're broken so i don't want them here.

Generally, some mods require the "[Bettermods](https://github.com/miroxik74/dbs-mods/blob/main/mods/BetterMods.js)", "[Bettermods V2](https://github.com/miroxik74/dbs-mods/blob/main/mods/BetterModsV2.js)", or/and the "[AAA_Bettermods](https://github.com/miroxik74/dbs-mods/blob/main/mods/AAA_BetterMods.js)" mods.  
To avoid unnecessary struggling and errors, just put all of these mods into your mods folder and have `discord.js@13.17.1` installed.  

If you want to do some changes for `interactionCreate` event and you have `AAA_BetterMods.js`, make them there, not in `bot.js`  

Oh, why not in `bot.js` ?
> Hmm... Simply put, because it overwrites the data from `bot.js` and every time you'll open the app or start your bot, then the changes you made to the code will/may be undone

Also big thanksies for everyone's work!!! ^-^  
*if not for you, this app would be dead a loooong time ago...*
